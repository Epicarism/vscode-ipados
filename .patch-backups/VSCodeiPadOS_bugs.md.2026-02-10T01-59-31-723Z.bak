# Known Bugs - VSCodeiPadOS

## 🔴 Critical

### 1. Scrolling is Broken / Jaggy
**Status:** Active  
**Symptoms:**
- Scrolling fights with the current line view
- If cursor is on a different line, editor wants to keep that line in focus
- Results in jaggy/jumpy scrolling behavior

**Likely Cause:**
- `scrollToLine()` or cursor position tracking in SyntaxHighlightingTextView
- `updateUIView` may be resetting scroll position on every update
- Conflict between user scroll and programmatic scroll to cursor

**Files to investigate:**
- `SyntaxHighlightingTextView.swift` - scrollToLine, updateScrollPosition
- `ContentView.swift` - scrollPosition binding
- MinimapView scroll sync

---

### 2. Syntax Highlighting Only Appears When Typing
**Status:** Active  
**Symptoms:**
- Syntax highlighting doesn't appear on file open
- Only shows up after user starts typing
- Even then, highlighting is inconsistent/partial

**Likely Cause:**
- `applySyntaxHighlighting()` not called on initial load
- Highlighting may be getting cleared/overwritten
- Theme not applied until text changes trigger delegate

**Files to investigate:**
- `SyntaxHighlightingTextView.swift` - makeUIView, applySyntaxHighlighting
- When/how highlighting is triggered on file load vs on edit

---

### 3. File Type Icons Missing from Sidebar
**Status:** Active  
**Symptoms:**
- No file type icons showing in file explorer sidebar
- VS Code style icons for html, js, json, md, swift, etc. not visible

**Expected:**
- Downloaded VS Code icons should display next to filenames
- Different icons for different file extensions

**Files to investigate:**
- FileNavigator / FileExplorerView
- Assets.xcassets - check if icons were added
- Icon mapping logic

---

### 4. Keyboard Shortcuts Were Broken (Cmd+J, Cmd+Shift+A, etc.)
**Status:** ✅ FIXED  
**What happened:**
- Accidentally removed UIKeyCommands thinking they were duplicates
- UITextView captures keyboard, so UIKeyCommands ARE needed there
- Restored all shortcuts: Cmd+J, Cmd+Shift+A, Cmd+B, Cmd+P, Cmd+S, Cmd+W, Cmd+F, Cmd+N, Cmd+=, Cmd+-

---

## 🟡 Medium Priority

### 3. "Publishing changes from within view updates" Warnings
**Status:** Partially addressed  
**Notes:** Some DispatchQueue.main.async wrapping added, may need more

---

## 🟢 Fixed (This Session)

- ✅ Fatal crash: Range requires lowerBound <= upperBound
- ✅ Duplicate keyboard shortcuts (UIMenu conflicts)
- ✅ Invalid SF Symbol 'f.curlybraces'
