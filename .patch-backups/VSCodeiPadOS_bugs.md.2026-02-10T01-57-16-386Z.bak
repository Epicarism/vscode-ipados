# Known Bugs - VSCodeiPadOS

## 🔴 Critical

### 1. Scrolling is Broken / Jaggy
**Status:** Active  
**Symptoms:**
- Scrolling fights with the current line view
- If cursor is on a different line, editor wants to keep that line in focus
- Results in jaggy/jumpy scrolling behavior

**Likely Cause:**
- `scrollToLine()` or cursor position tracking in SyntaxHighlightingTextView
- `updateUIView` may be resetting scroll position on every update
- Conflict between user scroll and programmatic scroll to cursor

**Files to investigate:**
- `SyntaxHighlightingTextView.swift` - scrollToLine, updateScrollPosition
- `ContentView.swift` - scrollPosition binding
- MinimapView scroll sync

### 2. File Type Icons Missing from Sidebar
**Status:** Active  
**Symptoms:**
- No file type icons showing in file explorer sidebar
- VS Code style icons for html, js, json, md, swift, etc. not visible

**Expected:**
- Downloaded VS Code icons should display next to filenames
- Different icons for different file extensions

**Files to investigate:**
- FileNavigator / FileExplorerView
- Assets.xcassets - check if icons were added
- Icon mapping logic

## 🟡 Medium Priority
