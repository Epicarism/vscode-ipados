## Task
Test VSCode iPadOS app in simulator. Steps:

1. Build and install the app:
   - cd /Users/danielswagg/PLAYGROUND/vscode-ipados/VSCodeiPadOS
   - xcodebuild -scheme VSCodeiPadOS -destination 'platform=iOS Simulator,id=AB8E1469-F08C-4468-9CA4-A417C6443166' -derivedDataPath build build
   - Install: xcrun simctl install AB8E1469-F08C-4468-9CA4-A417C6443166 build/Build/Products/Debug-iphonesimulator/VSCodeiPadOS.app
   - Launch: xcrun simctl launch AB8E1469-F08C-4468-9CA4-A417C6443166 com.vscodeipad.VSCodeiPadOS

2. Test these features and report what works/broken:
   - Take screenshot to see initial state
   - Tap on files in sidebar to open them
   - Check if syntax highlighting shows colors
   - Test the bottom panel (Terminal tab)
   - Test the Git panel in sidebar
   - Try creating a new file (doc.badge.plus button)
   - Test typing in editor

Report back: what works, what's broken, with screenshots as evidence.

## Response
I understand you want me to test the VSCode iPadOS app in the simulator. However, I need to clarify something important about my capabilities:

**I cannot execute the commands you've listed.** My available tools are:
- Read/write files
- Search codebase
- Web search/fetch
- Browser tools (for web pages)

I **cannot**:
- Run `xcodebuild` or `xcrun` commands
- Install or launch apps in the simulator
- Take screenshots of the iOS Simulator
- Interact with the simulator UI (tapping, typing, etc.)

Let me first explore the codebase to see what's here, and then we can discuss how I might be able to help:
