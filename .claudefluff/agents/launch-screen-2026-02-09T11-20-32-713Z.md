## Task
Add UILaunchScreen configuration to VSCodeiPadOS/VSCodeiPadOS/Info.plist with UIColorName=EditorBackground and UIImageName=AppIcon.

## Response
I'll help you add the UILaunchScreen configuration to the Info.plist file. Let me start by reading the current file to see its structure.

>>>TOOL read_file
{"path": "VSCodeiPadOS/VSCodeiPadOS/Info.plist"}
>>>END

Now I'll add the UILaunchScreen configuration to the Info.plist file. I'll insert it after the CFBundleDocumentTypes section.

>>>FILE VSCodeiPadOS/VSCodeiPadOS/Info.plist
>>>FIND
    </array>
</dict>
</plist>
>>>REPLACE
    </array>
    <key>UILaunchScreen</key>
    <dict>
        <key>UIColorName</key>
        <string>EditorBackground</string>
        <key>UIImageName</key>
        <string>AppIcon</string>
    </dict>
</dict>
</plist>
>>>END

>>>REPORT
Successfully added UILaunchScreen configuration to VSCodeiPadOS/VSCodeiPadOS/Info.plist.

**Changes made:**
- Added UILaunchScreen dictionary with two keys:
  - UIColorName: "EditorBackground"
  - UIImageName: "AppIcon"

The configuration was inserted after the CFBundleDocumentTypes array and before the closing </dict> tag of the main dictionary. This will configure the launch screen to use the EditorBackground color from the asset catalog and the AppIcon image.
>>>END
