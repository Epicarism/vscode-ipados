## Task
Create test case `testTerminalOutputDisplays` for TerminalUITests.swift. This test verifies terminal output is displayed after executing a command. Include opening terminal, typing a simple command (e.g., 'echo test'), pressing return, and verifying output text appears. Return only the test function code as a string.

## Response
 I'll first explore the codebase to find the TerminalUITests.swift file and understand its structure.
