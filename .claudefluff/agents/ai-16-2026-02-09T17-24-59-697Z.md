## Task
Implement multi-line suggestion support in VSCodeiPadOS/VSCodeiPadOS/Views/Editor/InlineSuggestionView.swift. Support: 1) Render suggestions spanning multiple lines with proper vertical alignment, 2) Show vertical line indicator for multi-line blocks, 3) Handle newlines and indentation matching, 4) Proper height calculation for overlay. Make it look like Copilot's multi-line ghost text.

## Response
 I'll start by reading the current implementation of InlineSuggestionView.swift to understand the existing code structure. 

 >>>TOOL read_file
{"path": "VSCodeiPadOS/VSCodeiPadOS/Views/Editor/InlineSuggestionView.swift"}
>>>END

  Let me search for the file in the codebase: >>>TOOL search
{"query": "InlineSuggestionView.swift", "glob": "*.swift"}
>>>END

  >>>TOOL list_dir
{"path": "."}
>>>END

   >>>TOOL list_dir
{"path": "VSCodeiPadOS"}
>>>END

   Let me try listing the directory with the full path:  >>>TOOL list_dir
{"path": "VSCodeiPadOS/VSCodeiPadOS/Views/Editor"}
>>>END

   It seems the file doesn't exist yet and I need to create it. Let me search for any related files in the project to understand the existing structure:  >>>TOOL search
{"query": ".swift", "glob": "*.swift"}
>>>END
