## Task
COORDINATOR: Additional Features (10 tasks)

You are a coordinator. Spawn agents to complete ALL these tasks:

Tasks:
1. FEAT-131: Minimap - code preview on right side
2. FEAT-132: Hover info - documentation on hover
3. FEAT-133: Inlay hints - type annotations inline
4. FEAT-134: Go to definition - Cmd+Click or F12
5. FEAT-135: Peek definition - inline preview
6. FEAT-136: Find all references
7. FEAT-137: Snippets - user-defined code templates
8. FEAT-138: Workspace settings - per-project config
9. FEAT-139: Tasks - build tasks, run configurations
10. FEAT-140: Launch configurations - debug configs

RULES:
- Use opus for go-to-definition logic
- Use gpt52 for other features
- Use gemini3 for hover/peek styling
- NO SONNET
- Update Views/Editor/MinimapView.swift
- Create Services/NavigationManager.swift, SnippetsManager.swift, WorkspaceManager.swift
- BUILD and verify

## Response
I'll coordinate the implementation of all 10 additional features. Let me first explore the codebase structure to understand existing patterns.

>>>TOOL list_dir
{"path": "."}
>>>END

>>>TOOL list_dir
{"path": "Views/Editor"}
>>>END

>>>TOOL list_dir
{"path": "Services"}
>>>END

Let me explore the project structure more deeply to understand the codebase.

>>>TOOL list_dir
{"path": "VSCodeiPadOS"}
>>>END

>>>TOOL list_dir
{"path": "Views"}
>>>END

>>>TOOL list_dir
{"path": "Models"}
>>>END

>>>TOOL list_dir
{"path": "VSCodeiPadOS/VSCodeiPadOS"}
>>>END

>>>TOOL list_dir
{"path": "VSCodeiPadOS/VSCodeiPadOS/Services"}
>>>END

>>>TOOL list_dir
{"path": "VSCodeiPadOS/VSCodeiPadOS/Views"}
>>>END

>>>TOOL read_file
{"path": "VSCodeiPadOS/VSCodeiPadOS/ContentView.swift"}
>>>END

Now I understand the codebase structure. Let me check existing services and the Editor views folder for patterns.

>>>TOOL list_dir
{"path": "VSCodeiPadOS/VSCodeiPadOS/Views/Editor"}
>>>END

>>>TOOL read_file
{"path": "VSCodeiPadOS/VSCodeiPadOS/Services/EditorCore.swift"}
>>>END

Let me check the existing MinimapView and understand patterns before spawning agents.

>>>TOOL read_file
{"path": "VSCodeiPadOS/VSCodeiPadOS/Views/Editor/MinimapView.swift"}
>>>END

Now I have a clear picture of the codebase. Let me spawn agents to implement all 10 features in parallel. I'll organize them based on the rules:
- **opus** for go-to-definition logic (FEAT-134)
- **gemini3** for hover/peek styling (FEAT-132, FEAT-135)
- **gpt52** for all other features
