## Task
Update VSCodeiPadOS/VSCodeiPadOS/Views/Settings/AISettingsView.swift with new providers and inline suggestion settings. Add: 1) Groq, Mistral, DeepSeek API key fields, 2) Inline suggestions enable/disable toggle, 3) Suggestion delay slider (100ms-1000ms), 4) Provider priority for inline completions, 5) Cache settings. Use same design pattern as existing settings.

## Response
 

 

 I'll start by reading the existing AISettingsView.swift file to understand the current design pattern and then update it with the requested features. 

 Let me read the existing AISettingsView.swift file to understand the current design pattern.  

  >>>TOOL read_file
{"path": "VSCodeiPadOS/VSCodeiPadOS/Views/Settings/AISettingsView.swift"}
>>>END

 Let me search for the correct file path first.    >>>TOOL search
{"query": "AISettingsView.swift"}
>>>END

  Let me search more broadly for Settings views or AI-related files.     >>>TOOL search
{"query": "SettingsView.swift"}
>>>END



   Let me list the directory structure to find the correct path.      >>>TOOL list_dir
{"path": "."}
>>>END

  Let me explore the VSCodeiPadOS directory structure more:      >>>TOOL list_dir
{"path": "VSCodeiPadOS"}
>>>END

  Let me check the Views directory for the Settings folder:    >>>TOOL list_dir
{"path": "VSCodeiPadOS/VSCodeiPadOS/Views"}
>>>END

  I notice there's no Settings folder in the Views directory. Let me search for any AI-related settings files:     >>>TOOL search
{"query": "AI.*Settings|Settings.*AI|Groq|Mistral|DeepSeek", "glob": "*.swift"}
>>>END

   Let me search for all Swift files to understand the project structure better:     >>>TOOL search
{"query": ".*", "glob": "*.swift"}
>>>END

   Let me list the root VSCodeiPadOS directory to see the full structure:      >>>TOOL list_dir
{"path": "VSCodeiPadOS/VSCodeiPadOS"}
>>>END

   Let me search for any existing settings files to understand the design pattern:     >>>TOOL search
{"query": "Settings", "glob": "*.swift"}
>>>END

    Let me list all files in the Views directory recursively:     >>>TOOL list_dir
{"path": "VSCodeiPadOS/VSCodeiPadOS/Views"}
>>>END

      I can see there's a `WorkspaceSettingsView.swift` file. Let me read it to understand the design pattern, and I'll also need to create the Settings folder and AISettingsView.swift file.     >>>TOOL read_file
{"path": "VSCodeiPadOS/VSCodeiPadOS/Views/Panels/WorkspaceSettingsView.swift"}
>>>END
