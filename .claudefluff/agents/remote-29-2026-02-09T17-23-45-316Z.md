## Task
Test environment variable handling - verify environment variables are properly set on remote side, verify inheritance from system env, verify .env file loading, verify PATH handling.

## Response
   

 I'll start by exploring the codebase to understand how environment variables are handled in the remote runner. Let me first look at the directory structure and then examine the RemoteRunner.swift file.

>>>TOOL list_dir
{"path": "/Users/danielswagg/PLAYGROUND/vscode-ipados"}
>>>END

>>>TOOL read_file
{"path": "/Users/danielswagg/PLAYGROUND/vscode-ipados/VSCodeiPadOS/VSCodeiPadOS/Services/RemoteRunner.swift"}
>>>END

>>>END

Let me first look at the directory structure to understand the project layout and then examine the RemoteRunner.swift file.  I'll start by exploring the codebase to understand the structure and examine the RemoteRunner.swift file where environment variable handling should be implemented.

>>>TOOL list_dir
{"path": "/Users/danielswagg/PLAYGROUND/vscode-ipados"}
>>>TOOL read_file

>>>END

>>>TOOL list_dir
{"path": "/Users/danielswagg/PLAYGROUND/vscode-ipados"}
>>>END

  I see there's a restriction on allowed paths. Let me read the RemoteRunner.swift file using the allowed path.  Let me read the RemoteRunner.swift file directly:

>>>TOOL read_file
{"path": "VSCodeiPadOS/VSCodeiPadOS/Services/RemoteRunner.swift"}
>>>END

   The file doesn't exist at that path. Let me search for files in the project to find the correct structure and locate where remote runner and environment variable handling might be implemented.  Let me search for Swift files and RemoteRunner in the project:

>>>TOOL search
{"query": "RemoteRunner", "glob": "*.swift"}
>>>TOOL search
{"query": "environment", "glob": "*.swift"}
>>>TOOL list_dir
{"path": "."}
>>>END

    It seems the search tool has restrictions on paths. Let me try a different approach and search without a glob pattern to find all files.  Let me search for relevant files in the entire project:

>>>TOOL search
{"query": "RemoteRunner"}
>>>TOOL search
{"query": "environment"}
>>>TOOL search
{"query": "Process", "glob": "*.swift"}
>>>END

   The search didn't find RemoteRunner specifically. Let me search for files related to remote execution and environment variables. Let me also search for SSH, Process, and env-related code.  Let me search more specifically for remote execution and environment variable handling:

>>>TOOL search
{"query": "SSH"}
>>>TOOL search
{"query": "ProcessInfo"}
>>>TOOL search
{"query": "Process.Process"}
>>>TOOL search
{"query": ".env"}
>>>END

     The search results don't show RemoteRunner.swift, but I can see there's a JSRunner.swift. Let me search more specifically for "remote", "runner", and "env" to find the relevant files. Let me also search for Process and environment variable handling.  Let me search for more specific terms related to environment variables and remote execution:

>>>TOOL search
{"query": "remote"}
>>>TOOL search
{"query": "runner"}
>>>TOOL search
{"query": "env"}
>>>TOOL search
{"query": "PATH"}
>>>END
