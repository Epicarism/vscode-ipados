## Task
Test SSHManager.swift command execution - verify that the enhanced SSHManager properly handles exec channels, captures stdout/stderr separately, returns correct exit codes, and handles concurrent command execution without interference.

## Response
 I'll start by examining the SSHManager.swift file to understand its current implementation and then test its command execution capabilities. 

 Let me start by examining the SSHManager.swift file to understand its current implementation. 

 >>>TOOL read_file
{"path": "VSCodeiPadOS/VSCodeiPadOS/Services/SSHManager.swift"}
>>>END

  Now let me look for any test files or related files to understand the testing infrastructure: >>>TOOL search
{"query": "SSHManager test exec channel command", "glob": "*.swift"}
>>>END

   Let me search for any test files in the project: >>>TOOL search
{"query": "test", "glob": "*Test*.swift"}
>>>END

    Let me explore the directory structure to find test files: >>>TOOL list_dir
{"path": "VSCodeiPadOS/VSCodeiPadOS"}
>>>END

      I see - I can only modify SSHManager.swift. Let me read the file again to analyze its command execution capabilities, particularly the `send(command:)` method and how it handles exec channels.

Based on my analysis of the SSHManager.swift file (lines 1-539), I can now test the command execution functionality. Let me look for any existing tests and then create a comprehensive test to verify the functionality.  Let me read the SSHManager.swift file again to analyze the command execution capabilities:>>>TOOL read_file
{"path": "VSCodeiPadOS/VSCodeiPadOS/Services/SSHManager.swift", "start_line": 380, "end_line": 420}
>>>END

      The file has been extended significantly. Let me read more of the file to see the full implementation including exec channel support:>>>TOOL read_file
{"path": "VSCodeiPadOS/VSCodeiPadOS/Services/SSHManager.swift", "start_line": 1, "end_line": 100}
>>>END

         Let me continue reading to see the exec channel support:>>>TOOL read_file
{"path": "VSCodeiPadOS/VSCodeiPadOS/Services/SSHManager.swift", "start_line": 420, "end_line": 550}
>>>END

           I found the exec command implementation starting at line 548. Let me read more:>>>TOOL read_file
{"path": "VSCodeiPadOS/VSCodeiPadOS/Services/SSHManager.swift", "start_line": 550, "end_line": 700}
>>>END



  >>>TOOL read_file
{"path": "VSCodeiPadOS/VSCodeiPadOS/Services/SSHManager.swift", "start_line": 550, "end_line": 700}
>>>END



    I need to see the results from the last tool call before proceeding. Let me wait for the results.    Let me wait for the results and continue reading the file:  >>>TOOL read_file
{"path": "VSCodeiPadOS/VSCodeiPadOS/Services/SSHManager.swift", "start_line": 550, "end_line": 700}
>>>END

            Let me continue reading to see the rest of the async implementation and the handler classes:>>>TOOL read_file
{"path": "VSCodeiPadOS/VSCodeiPadOS/Services/SSHManager.swift", "start_line": 700, "end_line": 862}
>>>END
