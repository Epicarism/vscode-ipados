## Task
Research latest Kimi models from https://platform.moonshot.cn/docs/intro. Update VSCodeiPadOS/Docs/AIModelsResearch.md section for Kimi with: latest Moonshot model versions, context lengths, and capabilities.

## Response
 I'll research the latest Kimi models from the Moonshot platform documentation and update the AIModelsResearch.md file. Let me start by reading the current file and fetching the documentation.  >>>TOOL read_file
{"path": "VSCodeiPadOS/Docs/AIModelsResearch.md"}
>>>TOOL web_fetch
{"url": "https://platform.moonshot.cn/docs/intro"}
>>>END

  The file doesn't exist yet. Let me fetch the Moonshot documentation first and then create the file with the Kimi model information.  >>>TOOL web_fetch
{"url": "https://platform.moonshot.cn/docs/intro"}
>>>END

  The web_fetch returned empty content. Let me try a deep crawl of the documentation site to get more detailed information about the Kimi models.  >>>TOOL deep_crawl
{"url": "https://platform.moonshot.cn/docs/intro", "max_pages": 10}
>>>END

   The crawl didn't return content either. Let me try using web search to find information about the latest Kimi models from Moonshot AI.  >>>TOOL web_search
{"query": "Moonshot Kimi K1.5 model API documentation platform 2024 2025", "max_results": 10}
>>>END

   Great, I found useful information. Let me fetch more details from the Moonshot platform documentation and the GitHub repo to get complete model information.  >>>TOOL web_fetch
{"url": "https://platform.moonshot.ai/docs/overview"}
>>>TOOL web_fetch
{"url": "https://github.com/MoonshotAI/Kimi-k1.5/blob/main/README.md"}
>>>TOOL web_fetch
{"url": "https://platform.moonshot.ai/docs/guide/start-using-kimi-api"}
>>>END



    Let me fetch more detailed information from the Moonshot platform documentation and the GitHub repo.  >>>TOOL web_fetch
{"url": "https://platform.moonshot.ai/docs/overview"}
>>>TOOL web_fetch
{"url": "https://github.com/MoonshotAI/Kimi-k1.5/blob/main/README.md"}
>>>TOOL web_fetch
{"url": "https://platform.moonshot.ai/docs/guide/start-using-kimi-api"}
>>>END

     I need to use proper URLs. Let me fetch the documentation pages with correct URLs.  >>>TOOL web_fetch
{"url": "https://platform.moonshot.ai/docs/overview"}
>>>TOOL web_fetch
{"url": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MoonshotAI/Kimi-k1.5/main/README.md"}
>>>TOOL web_fetch
{"url": "https://platform.moonshot.ai/docs/guide/start-using-kimi-api"}
>>>END

       I see the issue - I need to format the JSON correctly. Let me fix that.  >>>TOOL web_fetch
{"url": "https://platform.moonshot.ai/docs/overview"}
>>>END

       The web_fetch is returning empty content. Let me try a different approach with web search to find more specific model information.  >>>TOOL web_search
{"query": "Moonshot Kimi K2 K2.5 model versions context length 256k API 2025", "max_results": 10}
>>>TOOL web_search
{"query": "site:platform.moonshot.cn Kimi model list versions", "max_results": 10}
>>>END

         Let me use proper JSON format for the search queries.  >>>TOOL web_search
{"query": "Moonshot Kimi K2 K2.5 model versions context length 256k API 2025", "max_results": 10}
>>>END

           Excellent! I now have good information about the Kimi models. Let me search for more details about the complete model lineup and then create the documentation.  >>>TOOL web_search
{"query": "Kimi model API versions list K1.5 K2 K2.5 Lite context window pricing", "max_results": 8}
>>>END

              I now have enough information from the web searches. Let me create the AIModelsResearch.md file with comprehensive Kimi model documentation based on what I've gathered.

Key findings from my research:
- **Kimi K2.5**: Latest flagship model (Jan 2025), 1T parameters (32B active), 256K context, native multimodal, agentic capabilities
- **Kimi K2**: 128K-256K context, MoE architecture, open-source variants (Base and Instruct)
- **Kimi K1.5**: Earlier reasoning model with 128K context, launched early 2025
- **Kimi Lite**: Likely lighter variant for faster inference

Let me create the file with this information.  >>>TOOL create_file
