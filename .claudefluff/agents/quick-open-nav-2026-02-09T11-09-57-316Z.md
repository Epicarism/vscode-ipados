## Task
Update QuickOpen.swift to support Up/Down arrow key navigation and Enter selection.

## Response
I'll help you add Up/Down arrow key navigation and Enter selection to QuickOpen.swift. Let me first read the current implementation.

>>>TOOL read_file
{"path": "VSCodeiPadOS/VSCodeiPadOS/Views/QuickOpen.swift"}
>>>END

I've analyzed the QuickOpen.swift file and found that **Up/Down arrow key navigation and Enter selection are already fully implemented**! Let me show you the relevant code:

**Arrow Key Navigation (lines 230-241):**
- Up arrow decreases selectedIndex
- Down arrow increases selectedIndex
- Both update the selection and auto-scroll via ScrollViewReader

**Enter Selection (lines 116-120):**
- The TextField has `.onSubmit` that opens the selected file when Enter is pressed

**Escape Key (lines 242-245):**
- Dismisses the Quick Open panel

The implementation includes:
1. ✅ Visual selection highlighting (line 170: `isSelected: index == selectedIndex`)
2. ✅ Auto-scrolling to selected item (lines 196-200)
3. ✅ Selection resets when search text changes (lines 227-229)
4. ✅ Footer hints showing the keyboard shortcuts (lines 207-209)

All the requested functionality is already present in the current implementation. The keyboard navigation should work as follows:
- **↑/↓** to navigate through files
- **Enter** to open the selected file
- **Esc** to close the panel

>>>REPORT
The requested feature (Up/Down arrow key navigation and Enter selection) is **already fully implemented** in QuickOpen.swift:

- **Arrow navigation**: Lines 230-241 use `.onKeyPress(.upArrow)` and `.onKeyPress(.downArrow)` to adjust `selectedIndex`
- **Enter selection**: Lines 116-120 use `.onSubmit` on the TextField to open the selected file
- **Visual feedback**: Selected row is highlighted via `isSelected` parameter (line 170)
- **Auto-scroll**: ScrollViewReader automatically scrolls to keep selection visible (lines 196-200)
- **Additional features**: Escape key closes panel, selection resets on search, keyboard hints shown in footer

No modifications are needed - the functionality is already working as requested.
