## Task
Test tasks.json remote execution - verify RemoteRunner can load and execute tasks from .vscode/tasks.json on remote server, verify variable substitution, verify problem matcher integration.

## Response
 I'll help you test tasks.json remote execution. Let me start by exploring the codebase to understand the current implementation of RemoteRunner and TasksManager. 

 >>>TOOL list_dir
{"path": "/Users/danielswagg/PLAYGROUND/vscode-ipados"}
>>>END

>>>TOOL read_file
{"path": "/Users/danielswagg/PLAYGROUND/vscode-ipados/VSCodeiPadOS/VSCodeiPadOS/Services/RemoteRunner.swift"}
>>>END

>>>TOOL read_file
{"path": "/Users/danielswagg/PLAYGROUND/vscode-ipados/VSCodeiPadOS/VSCodeiPadOS/Services/TasksManager.swift"}
>>>END

  Let me try with the relative path as specified in the permissions:   >>>TOOL read_file
{"path": "VSCodeiPadOS/VSCodeiPadOS/Services/RemoteRunner.swift"}
>>>END

>>>TOOL read_file
{"path": "VSCodeiPadOS/VSCodeiPadOS/Services/TasksManager.swift"}
>>>END

  Now let me check if RemoteRunner.swift exists and explore the project structure to understand the remote execution architecture.   >>>TOOL search
{"query": "RemoteRunner", "glob": "*.swift"}
>>>END

>>>TOOL search
{"query": "tasks.json remote", "glob": "*.swift"}
>>>END

>>>TOOL search
{"query": "problemMatcher", "glob": "*.swift"}
>>>END

  It appears the RemoteRunner.swift and TasksManager.swift files don't exist yet. Let me search the codebase to understand the project structure and find any existing task-related code.  >>>TOOL search
{"query": "tasks", "glob": "*.swift"}
>>>END

>>>TOOL search
{"query": "RemoteRunner", "glob": "*.swift"}
>>>END

>>>TOOL search
{"query": "tasks.json"}
>>>END

>>>TOOL list_dir
{"path": "."}
>>>END

   Let me check if there's a RemoteRunner.swift file in the Services directory or if it needs to be created. Let me also look for any remote execution related code:   >>>TOOL list_dir
{"path": "VSCodeiPadOS/VSCodeiPadOS/Services"}
>>>END

>>>TOOL search
{"query": "class.*Remote", "glob": "*.swift"}
>>>END

>>>TOOL search
{"query": "remote|ssh|server", "glob": "*.swift"}
>>>END

 Let me search for the entire project structure and find all Swift files to understand what's available:   >>>TOOL search
{"query": "*.swift", "glob": "*.swift"}
>>>END

>>>TOOL search
{"query": "func|class|struct", "glob": "*.swift"}
>>>END

>>>TOOL search
{"query": "execute|run|command", "glob": "*.swift"}
>>>END

   It seems the project structure is empty or the Swift files don't exist yet. Let me check what's actually in the working directory:   >>>TOOL search
{"query": "."}
>>>END

>>>TOOL search
{"query": "import Foundation|import UIKit|import SwiftUI"}
>>>END

>>>TOOL get_errors
{}
>>>END

   Good! I can see there are files in the project. Let me search more specifically for the Services directory structure and look for any existing files related to tasks or remote execution:  >>>TOOL search
{"query": "Services/RemoteRunner"}
>>>END

>>>TOOL search
{"query": "Services/TasksManager"}
>>>END

>>>TOOL search
{"query": "task|Task", "glob": "*.swift"}
>>>END

>>>TOOL search
{"query": "class.*Runner|struct.*Runner"}
>>>END

   I see the project structure references RemoteRunner.swift and TasksManager.swift in the plan. The files don't exist yet and need to be created. Let me check if there's an existing project structure to understand the architecture better:  >>>TOOL search
{"query": "Services/", "glob": "*.swift"}
>>>END

>>>TOOL search
{"query": "NetworkService|SSHService|RemoteService"}
>>>END

>>>TOOL read_file
{"path": "MASTER_AGENT_PLAN.md"}
>>>END

    Let me read the backup files that were found earlier to understand the existing TasksManager implementation, and then look for any existing remote execution infrastructure:  >>>TOOL read_file
{"path": ".patch-backups/VSCodeiPadOS_VSCodeiPadOS_Services_TasksManager.swift.2026-02-09T11-21-07-062Z.bak"}
>>>END

>>>TOOL search
{"query": "Remote|SSH|Connection", "glob": "*.swift"}
>>>END

>>>TOOL search
{"query": "NMSSH|Libssh2|Foundation.NSFileHandle"}
>>>END

 Let me check the backup files that were found earlier to understand the expected implementation:   >>>TOOL read_file
{"path": ".patch-backups/VSCodeiPadOS_VSCodeiPadOS_Services_TasksManager.swift.2026-02-09T11-21-07-062Z.bak"}
>>>END

   I see the issue - I can only read/write to the two

  Let me search for existing backup content to understand the expected implementation:   >>>TOOL search
{"query": "TasksManager|TaskDefinition|ProblemMatcher", "glob": "*.bak"}
>>>END

>>>TOOL search
{"query": "variableSubstitution|resolveVariables|workspaceFolder", "glob": "*.bak"}
>>>END

>>>TOOL search
{"query": "remoteExecute|executeOnRemote|sshExecute", "glob": "*.bak"}
>>>END

  Let me search all files for any task-related or remote execution code:   >>>TOOL search
{"query": "json|JSON", "glob": "*"}
>>>END

>>>TOOL search
{"query": "execute|run|exec", "glob": "*"}
>>>END

>>>TOOL search
{"query": "vscode|VSCode", "glob": "*"}
>>>END

  Let me try a broader search to find any relevant files:  >>>TOOL search
{"query": "swift", "glob": "*"}
>>>END

>>>TOOL search
{"query": "class|struct|protocol", "glob": "*.swift"}
>>>END

>>>TOOL get_symbols
{"path": "VSCodeiPadOS/VSCodeiPadOS/Services/RemoteRunner.swift"}
>>>END

>>>TOOL get_symbols
{"path": "VSCodeiPadOS/VSCodeiPadOS/Services/TasksManager.swift"}
>>>END
